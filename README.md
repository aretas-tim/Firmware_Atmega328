# Firmware_Atmega328p

This repo holds .cpp, .h, .pde and .ino files for firmware across multiple projects. 
The .cpp and .h files are generally necessary to include in projects as the .ino and .pde files require them as dependencies.
We typically use this code base exclusively for the Atmega328 processor.
